# Hi there! I'm Maria 👋

I'm a chemist and researcher specialized in materials science, currently expanding my skill set with data analysis and visualization tools.

🔬 Experience in R&D, synthesis, and characterization of solid-state materials  
📊 Data analysis using Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI  
🌱 Passionate about sustainability, innovation, and applied science  
🧠 I bring analytical thinking from science, and now I use it to work with data at scale.

## 📊 Featured Projects (Core Field)

- 🌍 [Climate Crisis Data Analysis](https://github.com/Adalab/project-da-promo-50-modulo-4-team-4.git)
  
Participated in a multidisciplinary team to analyze and visualize climate change indicators from four critical perspectives: sea level rise, agricultural economic impact, deforestation, and CO₂ emissions.
Led the data preparation phase using Python — including cleaning, handling missing values, renaming, filtering by dates and countries — to ensure data quality and consistency.
Developed interactive dashboards with Power BI to translate complex datasets into accessible visual stories, enabling stakeholders to grasp key climate trends.
This project demonstrates my ability to work collaboratively on large datasets, apply data wrangling and visualization techniques, and communicate scientific insights effectively to diverse audiences.

## 🌐 Additional Projects (Data Analysis Outside Core Field)

- ✈️ [Customer & Flight Activity Analysis](https://github.com/Adalab/bda-modulo-3-evaluacion-final-tapiamm.git)
  
End-to-end data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis of a flight loyalty program dataset using Python. Developed custom ETL functions for efficient data processing and applied advanced visualization tools (matplotlib, seaborn) to extract actionable insights about customer behavior.
Conducted hypothesis testing (Kruskal-Wallis) to evaluate the effect of education level on flight bookings, showcasing my ability to combine statistical rigor with practical business questions.
This project highlights my data skills applied beyond my core field, demonstrating adaptability and a strong analytical mindset.

## 🧬 Background

Currently working as a **Material Scientist** in a biotech startup, scaling sustainable alternatives to traditional materials.  
My role bridges experimental work and data-driven process optimization.
